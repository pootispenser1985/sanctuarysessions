          <p class="bandname">Backpacks</p>
          <p>Backpacks is a four-piece alternative/punk band from Grand Rapids,
            Michigan. Since their beginning in 2014, the band have worked to
            develop their sound into something unique and completely their own.
            Following the release of their second EP, “Still Life” on Save Your
            Generation Records, the band began to receive attention from listeners
            outside of their local scene. Backpacks have recently announced the
            re-release of “Still Life” in the UK and Europe via Dirty Sushi Records
            and have plans to release plenty of new music before the end of 2016.</p>

          <p class="bandname">Mountains Like Wax</p>
          <p>Murfreesboro, TN based band Mountains Like Wax is satisfying hungry
            fans one show at a time with their relentlessly poignant and exuberant
            Southern post-rock. Having played over fifty plus shows in the past
            year and counting without a sound recording, they are proving to be a
            band to watch as they charge to the forefront of Middle Tennessee’s
            burgeoning indie rock scene. Mitchell Taylor (vocals, guitar), Samuel
            Katz (guitar), and Preston Vaughn (drums) are now ready to commit their
            sound to tape and make a rallying cry for their generation as they wrap
            arms around those begging to know will the future render glory, will it
            be pliable, or will it melt and fade?</p>

          <p class="bandname">The Touch</p>
          <p>We are a Nashville, TN based Dark Synth Pop ensemble. Our sound came
            about when vocalist Billy Blackman put his head together with Matt Ray
            and his analogue synthesizers. What came about was a collective of
            soundscapes that fit a dark setting, while still maintaining elements
            of dance, pop, and progressive music. When paired with the articulate
            push of Trey Blackman’s bass and the bombastic drumming of Matt McPeak,
            The Touch was born. Each track, theme, and lyric presented by The Touch
            is an original idea fabricated by the marriage of our minds. Feel the
            music just as much as you hear it.</p>
